# sysintegration
Primary goal of this repository is to document course material, as well as appropriate projects, in-line with system integration.

A self-imposed challenge, as well as a big point for system integration, is to use many different technologies. And show that language or technologies should not limit cohesion in system design and integration.

The main project for this repository is in the `Tours` directory.
